I built a fully responsive portfolio website featuring a sticky navigation header, hero section with my name and tagline, an About Me section, a Tools I Use list showcasing my development stack, a working contact form, and a footer. The page uses semantic HTML5 elements throughout and includes custom CSS styling with a modern purple gradient theme, smooth hover effects, and mobile-responsive design.

Through this project, I practiced essential HTML tags including structural elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for proper page organization. I also worked extensively with form elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<label>`, `<button>`) to create a functional contact form, list elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for navigation and tools sections, and text formatting tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<span>`) to add emphasis and style to content. This hands-on practice reinforced the importance of semantic HTML for accessibility and clean code structure.
